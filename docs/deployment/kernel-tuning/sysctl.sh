# `Transparent Hugepage Support`*: This is a Linux kernel feature intended to improve
# performance by making more efficient use of processorâ€™s memory-mapping hardware.
# But this may cause https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/performance-issues-with-transparent-huge-pages-thp
# for non-optimized applications. As most Linux distributions set it to `enabled=always` by default,
# we recommend changing this to `enabled=madvise`. This will allow applications optimized
# for transparent hugepages to obtain the performance benefits, while preventing the
# associated problems otherwise. Also, set `transparent_hugepage=madvise` on your kernel
# command line (e.g. in /etc/default/grub) to persistently set this value.
