# Nodes configuration
# This configuration makes the gateway use the first node (grpc://s01.neofs.devenv:8080)
# while it's healthy. Otherwise, gateway uses the second node (grpc://s01.neofs.devenv:8080)
# for 10% of requests and the third node (grpc://s03.neofs.devenv:8080) for 90% of requests.
# Until nodes with the same priority level are healthy
# nodes with other priority are not used.
# The lower the value, the higher the priority.
